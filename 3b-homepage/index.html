              <p class="bio">My name is <b>Choonghyun Charlie Nam</b>. 
                <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary artist currently studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. My current focus is on photography, film, and art/technology, while my academic background also includes studies in architecture and sculpture. My creative practice is an exploration of the intrinsic connections between these disciplines. 
                <br><br>I am particularly captivated by the visual aesthetics of geometry, which serve as the driving force behind my creative process. Much of my work revolves around the creation of simple yet abstract art and design that viewers can easily observe and understand.
                <br><br>This leads to my fascination with architecture. Architecture serves as both muse and medium in my artistic expression, especially in photography, where I strive to capture the essence of architectural form.

          <h2>Architecture Collage: Chicago</h2>
          <p>The Architecture Collage project was initially started as a simple collage exercise, but it quickly evolved into its own series. Inspired by the rich architectural diversity of the city of Chicago, I aimed to transform these familiar facades into a unique and mesmerizing experience by creating a new type of space by selecting images of architectural facades and arranging them according to geometric principles. </p>
