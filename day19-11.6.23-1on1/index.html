    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>1. What kind of website do you want to make for your final project? (Describe the finished project in detail)</h2>
    <p>I would like to make my portfolio website. I want it to be a clean website with my artworks in there. I currently have a website that I made from the Adobe portfolio. I would like to make a similar website that is clean and simple with not much going on. (I do have some ideas of some interactive elements that I would want to put in but don’t want to go super crazy with that)
    </p>
    <a href="https://cnam1.myportfolio.com/">My Current Portfolio</a>
    <br>

    <h2>2. Why do you want to make this project? (for example, you want a portfolio website for applying to things, or…you want to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new skill, or…you want a new work in your portfolio that shows off you skills as a web developer/designer/artist).</h2>
    <p>I want to make a portfolio website that I would like to keep and to show to others when applying for a job or just simply networking. I do also want to show that I am able to make my own website from scratch.
    I might not be able to put all of my work on the website on time for this project. But I would like to create a base so that I can finish my website later in the future.</p>

    <h2>3. What challenges (technical, conceptual, design, etc.) do you anticipate encountering in this project? To put that another way, what do you think you’ll struggle with the most with this project?
    </h2>
    <p>I guess I will have a lot of different technical challenges since this is the first time I am coding. That is one reason why I want to make this website into a simple layout (Not the main reason). </p>
